<p>This site was created due to the emerging numbers of official and corporate datasets related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Confusion has arisen from the low confidence in many of these individual data sources, such as headline death figures initially only including those in hospital. Collation and intepretation of as much of the available data as possible should further both public understanding and study of the data.</p>

<p>Making use of highly flexible and reactive javascript libraries as set out on the Web Technologies page, Covisualiser is able to achieve the above without any reliance on high-powered server architecture.</p>

<p>All credits and rights of the data sources used remain those of the original creators.</p>
